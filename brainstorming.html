    <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
    <p>
        To get started, get in group of four and discuss what you know, or what you think you know, about video games and violence. You initial discussion should be based around the following points:
        <ul>
            <li>Examples of violent games you know/play</li>
            <li>the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...</li>
            <li>what you feel when you play these violent games</li>
            <li>any real world cases of violence that have been related to video games</li>
            <li>your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on behaviour</li>
        </ul>
